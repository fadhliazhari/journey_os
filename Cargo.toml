# The isa-debug-exit device uses port-mapped I/O. The iobase parameter specifies on which port address 
# the device should live (0xf4 is a generally unused port on the x86â€™s IO bus) and the iosize specifies 
# the port size (0x04 means four bytes).

# With this configuration, bootimage maps our success exit code to exit code 0, so that cargo test correctly 
# recognizes the success case and does not count the test as failed.
